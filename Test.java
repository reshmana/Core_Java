class Test
1.java is programming langauge, whic is used to develop the software.
  javac is a compiler when the code end it compile the code 
2.jdk[java development kite]

  JRE.[java run time enviroment]
   this is whole responsible for compile   the file.it consist of libraries.

   JVM[java vertual machin]
   it is used to conver the java code into byte code
   byte code into java code(.class)
 java virtual machin . it is whole responsible for exicute the fil.


3.


5. variable is memory location it is used to store the value or data , 
      it can be change the No of time during exicution.
     1. literals
     2.methods
     3.construtor
     4.referance
   1.literals are initilize the value to referance variavle 
     example. String name ="Reshma"
    Method is collection pf statement whic will get exicuted when it is called or invoked.
   constructor. it is special type . it is used to initialize the variable
   variable are 2 type 
   class level
   -->static variable
   -->non static  variable/instance variable
   method level
   -->local variable
    -->parameter
   
6. object oriented programming.
   .incapsulation
   .polymorphisum.
   .inheritance
   .abstraction.it is hiding the information

8.data type:
    the varies and size are stored wich representvie data tye
     primitive data type
    char
   short
   double
   int
   float
   boolean 
   byte
  non primitive data type 
   String
   class 
   arrey

9.dot opperator use to access the variable name and method from the class
    class 

10. java features
   . it is secure
   .it is rebust
   .object oriented
   . multi- thread
   . exicution and interprited
   . it is a high speed


11. arrey is collection of homogineus elements
    arrey can be defined by using []
      String [] arrey={1,2,3,4,5}

12.class is a blue print to creat an object.
       class is keyword
      syntax{
           
            ////
           }

        class mobile{
                   String brand; 
                    int cost;
                 }
             
    object: object is a real time intity.
            it is instance of class


13. keywords: keywords are pre-defined which are used in program
         there are 48 keywords in java
    new
    super
    this
    absract
    asset
   final
   boolean
    byte
    return
    short
    continue

14.constructor: is a special method , it is used to initilize the varialbe 
               construtor is a many copies.
            we can write infinite constructor in one class
             no return typeeturn
            3 types of constructor
            defalt constructor
            parameter constructor
            copy construtor
              
             
15. main mathod is static becouse it assec the class name

 16 class arrey{
        
       public static void main(String[]args){
       arrey[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
          for(int i=0; i<arrey.length;i++);
          length arrey.[6]=7;
           

          System.out.printl("arrey length:"+[i]);
}
     }
